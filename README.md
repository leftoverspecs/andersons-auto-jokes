Chestnut Chase
==============

Deep in the dark forrest there are thousands of old chestnut tree with
ripe chestnuts in their capsule. It would be such shame to let the go
to waste by simply falling down to the earth and taking root next to
those parent trees.

It's the duty of our heros to collect tose chestnuts and to take them
to the next light-flooded clearing. But they have to be careful since
freshly sprouted chestnut seedlings have thick thorns!
